* Construction of First Principal Components
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: principal_component.ipynb
  :END:
  For some groups of questions it's interesting to construct some
  summary measure.  For example, we ask about the value of savings
  held at banks, at home, with BRAC, with other NGOs, and in other
  forms:
    #+name: list_items
    - savings_home_b
    - savings_bank_b
    - savings_BRAC_b
    - savings_NGOs_b
    - savings_other_b


  One obvious approach is to compute the sum of these, but what if
  some forms of savings are missing?  Should we assume these to be
  zero?  There are also valid zeros for different forms of savings
  (indeed, almost no one reports saving with any other NGO).


  The following code computes the first principal component of the
  variables in =list_items=, via a singular value decomposition and
  reports two outputs.  The first are the weights used to compute the
  first principal components, while the second is a histogram of the
  log of positive values of the first principal components.
