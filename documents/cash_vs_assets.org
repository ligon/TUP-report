* Introduction

What is the best way to help the poor?  In recent years a number of
researchers have experimented with some very direct approaches: giving
poor people productive assets citep:bandiera-etal17.[fn:: A number of
attempted replications of the experiment described in
cite:bandiera-etal17 are described in cite:banerjee-etal15.] and
giving poor people cash
citep:haushofer-shapiro14,blattman-etal16. 

Typically these experiments find positive effects on consumption
expenditures and assets, and sometimes shifts in time-use.  Yet while
there's evidence that these programs work, the experiments conducted
to date are not designed to say which intervention works /better/.

In this paper we describe the first experiment designed to answer the
"which works better" question.  The experiment was conducted on a
population of "ultra-poor" women in South Sudan.  Some women were
randomly assigned to receive productive assets, as part of a
"graduation" program modeled on the program described in
cite:bandiera-etal17; other women were randomly assigned to receive
lump-sum transfers of cash; yet other women were randomly assigned to
a control group, and received neither assets nor cash.

* The Setting

* The Experiment

The pilot program itself was similar to the other TUP programs completed by BRAC. It
consisted of four phases: targeting and selection, training and enterprise selection,
asset transfers, and monitoring. 

** Targeting, Selection, & Training

The first phase of the program was to complete a census of households in the area
around BRAC's office in the town of Yei in Western Equatoria. This census contained
questions to assess eligibility for the program. First, households were excluded if
they had a salaried worker in the household, were participating in another NGO
program, or had no access to cultivable land (which was in some cases necessary for
the program's model). Households were then deemed eligible if they fit at least three
criteria in a list of five poverty indicators:

1) The household head was working as a day laborer (generally an occupation with poverty wages),
2) The household had two or more children,
3) At least one child in the household was working,
4) The household had fewer than three rooms, or
5) A woman in the household had not completed secondary school.

The census was completed in April of 2013 and 745 were identified as eligible. Of
these, 649 were identified in a baseline survey. These households were stratified on
employment, asset ownership, and size and selected into treatment groups. 250 were
enrolled in the TUP program, 125 in the UCT group, and the final 274 in a pure
control group.

** Asset Transfers & Monitoring

The second phase of the program was training and enterprise selection. Unlike most
programs of this type, the number of households given each kind of asset was set in
advance, with 75 enrolled in agricultural activities (vegetable cultivation), 85 in
duck rearing, 45 in goat rearing, and the rest in small trade businesses. While the
staff tried to map housheolds' asset types to their respective preferences and
skills, a disproportionate number stated a preferences for goats and small trade.
Households then atttended training sessions. The first of these were for general
business skills around literacy, numercacy, and financial management. The next were
sector specific and focused on how to properly raise livestock or gardens. 

Once training is completed, asset transfers began in late 2013 and continued through
the first few months of 2014. The productive assets related to each enterprise were
valued at around $240 per household, with a random subset recieving an additional $60
in assets later in 2014. Shortly thereafter, households started to attend weekly or
semi-weekly meetings with other nearby participants to discuss with each other and a
BRAC extension officer the details of their businesses. These meetings also included
food transfers for a while, which were designed to help get households to the point
of receiving revenue from their assets without having to sell them.

** Cash Transfers 

In all, the market value of these food transfers were valued at $110, bringing the
total value of all transfers to $350-$410. The 125 households in the UCT group were
randomly divided in half to receive cash in these two amounts. Unfortunately, political
instability disrupted NGO operations throughtout South Sudan, preventing the
simultaneous disbursal of the cash and asset transfers. Instead, a second survey was
conducted in June of 2014, with the cash transfers being disbursed immediately
thereafter. This resulted in a timing difference of 3 to 6 months between the two
(since the asset transfers were rolled out over around 12 weeks).
This naturally complicates the comparison of treatment effects between the two
treatments. We will describe our empirical strategy in light of these challenges in
the Empirical Strategy section.

Cash transfers were delivered by field officers in person and in local
currency. That they were delivered in cash distinguishes it from
several other cash transfer programs.[fn:: For example,
cite:haushofer-shapiro16 deposited funds in a bank or mobile money
account, while cite:fafchamps-etal14 used money transfers.]
Experimental studies of the behavioral implications of savings
accounts citep:dupas-robinson13 would lead one to expect that the
method of disbursal method might affect the propensity to save a cash
transfer.  In all of these experiments transfers were denominated in
the local currency.  However, our context is unusual in that the local
economy was facing significant inflation at the time, with
year-on-year estimates ranging between 80% and 100%.  This would
naturally make holding cash a less appealing option relative to
consumption or investing in some real asset.

Local community leaders were approached in advance of talking to individual
households to reassure recipients of BRAC's intentions. It was made clear that the
transfers were there for their benefit, that while they were encouraged to put them
towards some productive use, their use was unrestricted, and that under no
circunstances would they receive a second transfer in the future. BRAC was a
well-established institution in the greater Yei community, so these assurances were
taken as credible and no refused to accept the money. 

* The Data

The census was conducted in April of 2013 in the area around BRAC's offices in Yei
County to identify women eligible for participation. A baseline survey was conducted
that Summer, which successfully interviewed 649 of these women and randomly selected
them into the TUP, UCT, and control groups. Half of each beneficiary group was
randomly selected to receive additional "top-up" transfers with market value of $60
(around 20% of the original transfers).

In response to the outbreak of violence in late 2013 and subsequent closing of the
offices in Yei, a midline survey was conducted in June 2014 to try to separate pre-
and post-conflict changes in outcomes. For lack of a valid comparison group, we will
not speak with any authority about the effect of the conflict on economic conditions
in Yei, though we will report estimates of treatment effects on the severity or
likelihood of having been effected exposure to the conflict. Some of the original
asset transfers were done before the office closure, which may affect estimates of
the difference between programs if rates of return changed in the few intervening
months. Finally, an endline survey was conducted in mid-2015 to estimate the effect
of program participation on households' financial situation and overall welfare. The
key here is that the survey conducted in mid-2014 provides us with /short-term/
treatment effects of the TUP program within 6 months of the asset transfers, while
providing a second baseline for the Cash transfers. Likewise, the 2015 survey
allows us to estimate treatment effects one year after the cash transfers, and 15-18
months after the asset transfers.

This unfortunately left us without data past one year for the cash transfer effects.
To get some point estimates on household welfare for this group in the slightly
longer term, we conducted a series of five short surveys on a monthly basis from
November of 2015 to March of 2016. These collected only a subset of the full
consumption modules and a few questions tracking major transactions and shocks. The
short length of the survey allowed them to be administered via the mobile network,
reducing cost and improving response rate. These data provide a slightly longer
estimate of treatment effects for both cash transfers and the TUP program, but will
be especially valuable in assessing whether the cash transfers had a long-term imact
on consumption.

* Empirical Strategy 

For the main panel (excluding the high-frequency mobile surveys), we estimate a
single model using interactions between time effects and group assignment, as well as
baseline values of the outcome variable where available.

\begin{equation*}
Y_{it} =\sum_{t=2014}^{2015}\delta_{t}+\beta_{t}^{Cash}I_{t}*Cash_{it}+\beta_{t}^{TUP}I_{t}*TUP_{it}+\gamma Y_{i,2013}+\epsilon_{i}
\end{equation*}
where $\delta_{t}$ are time fixed effects and $I_{t}$ is an indicator if the year
/t/, and $Y_{it}$ is an outcome of interest for household /i/ in year /t/. We take
the interactions of TUP assignment with 2014 and 2015 indicators as the treatment
effects at 6-8 and 15-17 months respectively. The analagous interactions with the
Cash group offer a second baseline and a 12-month treatment effect, respectively.
Since those transfers happened after the midline survey, its interaction with /2014/
acts as a placebo; there is no /ex ante/ reason to expect that they were different
from the rest of the control group at that point. Given the slight difference in
timing, we report a t-test of the hypothesis \(\beta_{TUP,t}-\beta_{Cash,2015}=0\) for
both \(t \in {2014,2015}\). Since the difference in timing is smaller, we consider
\(\beta_{TUP,2015}-\beta_{Cash,2015}=0\) to be the prefered hypothesis, but examine
adn report \(\beta_{TUP,2014}-\beta_{Cash,2015}=0\) as well.
 
For the supplementary analysis of the high-frequency panel, we estimate a separate
model, since the underlying data is so different. A constant parameter takes the
place of the fixed effects. We include 2013 levels as a covariate where possible.
Since we collect expenditures on only ten consumption items, we report not only the
total value of spending on those goods, but also a more theoretically grounded
measure described in cite:collins-ligon17, which uses the composition of
expenditures to derive the marginal utility of expenditures for each household. We
chose ten relatively demand-elastic items specifically for this purpose, as those
will tend to be the most responsive to changes in welfare. 


* Results
** Balance on Obervables

We start by checking whether either treatment arm appears significantly different
from the control group in terms of average baseline observable characteristics.
\Tab{balance_check} presents summary statistics by group on a range of factors
related to consumption, asset holdings, and household characteristics.

This is simply suggestive evidence that the treatment and control groups were similar
in observables at baseline, with the exception that the cash group has atypically
more motorcycles and clothing. But it does suggests that our stratified randomization
was not too far from creating comparable groups.

** Attrition

Another crucial question is to what extent attrition in the 2014
midline and 2015 endline surveys will bias our
results. \Tab{attrition_balanced_count} reports the same numbers
restricting ourselves to households reporting cereal consumption (a
minimal reporting requirement).  In the TUP group, we were unable to
find 21 participants in 2014 (8% attrition), but found 5 not
identified in the baseline survey. We found 8 additional TUP
households with baseline surveys again in 2015 for a final attrition
rate of 5%. Of those in the Cash group, 12 were lost (9.6%) in 2014,
then two more in 2015 (11%). The control group saw very high attrition
in 2014, missing 60 peope (22%). Enumerators also found a large number
of households not found at baseline, such that there were only 16
fewer surveys collected in 2014 than in 2013. The high attrition was
due largely to the fact that these households did not enjoy the same
consitent contact that BRAC had with the TUP group, and the local area
lacked infrastructure to easily locate people.  This was exacerbated
by the uncertain political situation and early harvest.  Attrition in
2015 was 6.7%, with 19 baseline control households not responding,
with 85 households found who were originally identified as control
households from the survey but not in the baseline survey. In order to
take advantage of the households not included in the baseline, the
main specification below follows \cite{banerjee-etal} by setting
missing values to zero when controlling for baseline levels of the
dependent variable, and including an indicator for whether the
household was in the baseline.

Next we ask how those who did not turn up in subsequent rounds
differed by a range of baseline characteristics. \Tab{attrition_means}
reports the average level of various characteristics at baseline
in 2013. Then we report the difference in means between households
that were in and out of the midline or endline surveys.  Here we see
that overall, households found in the midline survey were larger with
more children and larger reported asset stocks. Households found in
2015 seemed to have, at baseline, significantly smaller asset stocks
and less consumption. This imbalance highlights the need for a
difference-in-difference or ancova design.

** Consumption

The first measure of welfare we consider is household consumption, defined as the
market value of goods or services used by the household. A sizable basket of goods
was included in the survey module. These are separated into three categories: Food
items (with a 3-day recall window), non-durables (a 30-day recall window), and
durables and large expenditures (a one-year recall window). This is perhaps the most
obvious measure of the welfare or poverty of a household in our survey. 

The results for several important consumption measures are presented in Table
\ref{tab:consumption}.  We do not know about prices for each good in this
time, though we can say that inflation was as high as 100% between 2014 and 2015. We
take the sum of all consumption and expenditure questions together as a measure of
welfare. In light of the fact that we have data on an incomplete basket, we also
follow cite:collins-ligon17, which details a method for deriving treatment
effects on a structurally estimated index of households' marginal utility, which we
include here as \(\log\lambda_{it}\).

We measured the effect of cash on consumption 12 months after the fact, where we find
a statistically significant increase of 18 SSP per day, representing a roughly 16%
increase over the control-group average. We first measured the consumption effect of
the TUP program 6-9 months after the asset transfers, where we found a similarly
sized effect of 18SSP. However we find no evidence of a consumption effect 18-21
months after the transfers (and reject equality with the 12-month cash results). This
result leaves open the question of whether the cash treatment had a persistent effect
on consumption, or whether the short-term effect found in 2015 is similarly
temporary. It was this question that motivated the collection of an additional five
rounds of data over a 6-month period in late 2015 and early 2016, in which we asked
about ten items, five food and five non-food. In Table \Tab{tab:mobile_consumption},
we consider the average treatment effect on households sampled for these phone
interviews, both for \(\log\lambda_{it}\) and for total consumption of this basket of
goods. We find that, consistent with the TUP program's results in 2015, all evidence
of an effect seem to be gone by 18th months after the transfer date.

These results are consistent with a story in which either sort of transfer has a
short-term consumption effect, but with the result fading in the year after. In
either group, the increase in total consumption appears to be driven mainly by
increased food consumption, with smaller effects on non-food consumption goods and
durables. As such, there is no evidence that the share of food consumed falls, as
might be predicted by Engel's law.

** Food Insecurity

Observed changes in total consumption don't translate into an increase in reported
food security. In each year, we ask how often in a given week the respondent has had
experiences indicative of food insecurity. Included are (from left to right) going a
whole day without eating, going to sleep hungry, being without any food in the house,
eating fewer meals than normal at mealtimes, and limiting portions. We report the
percentage of people who report experiencing each in a typical week, as well as a
standardized composite z-score using all of these questions. Coefficients and
standard errors are both small relative to average levels and statistically
insignificant. The first column also aggregates these values as a weighted average
with inverse covariance weighting, yielding an index we call Food Insecurity. Again,
we find no systematic difference in food security.

** Assets
   
Turning now to asset holdings for the households, we estimate treatment effects for
total value of physical assets owned, total value of potentially productive assets,
as well as land and cash savings.

*** Total Asset Holdings

The cash group does not appear to have seen an increase in the value of assets
measured, with negative and imprecise point estimates. This contrasts sharply with
the TUP group, which seems to get notably wealthier and stay wealthier over time. The
TUP group has significantly more asset wealth than the cash or control groups in both
2014 and 2015, 18 months after receipt of transfers. They have 536 SSP more on
average in 2014 and 624 SSP more in 2015. So-called "Productive" assets include
anything that could plausibly be used in productive activity.[fn:: For now, we
include in this list: small and large livestock, farm equipment, mobiles, carts,
sewing equipment, sheds, and shop premises.] Here we see the TUP group has 320 SSP
(95%) more in this area over the control group, with a similar magnitude at midline.

Note also that the effect on total assets is higher in absolute value than the effect
on productive asset value, suggesting that the increased wealth cannot be explained
purely by households holding onto asset transfers for the length of the program's
monitoring phase. Indeed, we see in \Fig{fig:AssetTotal} that the TUP group is the
only one for whom total measured asset holdings did not fall on average over these
two years, which saw hyperinflation and a significant aggregate economic downturn.
This asset effect (including the savings effect below) is the only feature of
households' financial situation on which we we see a persistent effect.

*** Savings

The TUP households were strongly encouraged to pay into a savings account maintained
by BRAC at each of their weekly meetings. Anecdotally, this discouraged some women
from attending the meetings, but we can see in Table \Tab{tab:Nonzero} that did
manage to change behavior. TUP participants appear to be 48% (19 pp.) more likely to
report having any savings at all at endline compared to control households. It's
worth noting though that since the TUP households also regard their savings behavior
as much more transparent to BRAC (and have received pressure to save from them) than
the other groups, these households may simply be more likely to reveal that they are
saving when asked. Nonetheless, it seems notable that among the group that
received cash, households were no more likely than the control group to report having
positive cash savings. This suggests to us that receiving cash is not in itself
sufficient to induce households to start holding cash on hand or in an account.
Conversely, increases in savings among TUP households were due not only to their
increased wealth, but also to additional pressure to hold cash in a savings account.

In Table \Tab{tab:Savings}, we consider the amount of cash saved in each year among
those who reported savings. Here we see that cash and TUP groups increase the amount
saved by a similar amount, with cash transfer recipients holding 47% (91.4 SSP) more
and TUP households saving 42% (81.3 SSP) more. This is significantly less than was
given to these households, but combined with the short-term consumption results, goes
some distance in explaining the lack of effect on physical asset wealth. The cash
seems to have gone primarily to consumption and savings. The asset transfer program
on the other hand seems to have achieved a similar result among a greater proportion
of households in addition to a notable increase in asset wealth.

It is common in this community (and most in the region) to store non-perishable food
like maize, cassava, or millet as a form of savings. This would seem particularly
reasonable in a high-inflation context, where the price of grain had doubled in the
previous year. At least as many households report saving in food (53%) as in cash
(46%), with an average market value of 106 SSP. However, we find no evidence that
either treatment group increased food savings.[fn:: Note that food savings was not
measured at baseline, so these controls are omitted.]

Neither do we find evidence that either treatment increased the size or likelihood of
giving or receiving interhousehold transfers, either in cash or in kind. These
results are omitted since only 35 and 60 households reported giving and receiving
transfers respectively, with no difference in group means.

*** Land Holdings

We also examine land ownership and cultivation in each year. We find no evidence that
either group is more or less likely to report owning or cultivating at least some
land, though this may be in part because land ownership and cultivation is already
very common. Anecdotaly, divesting from land ownership entirely could be seen as a
relatively drastic decision. However, members of the cash group who are involved in
agriculture report cultivating 65% less and owning 70% less land than the control
group. This raises the interesting question of whether the cash group was likely to
switch occupations from farming to non-farm self-employment.

It could also raise questions around the underlying logic of the agrarian focus
transfer in the TUP program, if unconstrained transfers prompt households to divest
from these opportunities. This concern may be validated somewhat by the fact that TUP
participants primarily stated a preference for small retail training and transfers
over small animal husbandry or vegetable gardening.

** Income

Income was reliably measured only in 2015, and so our estimates do not control for
baseline values. The control group in 2015 has a measured income of roughly 4325 SSP
per year, or roughly $540 US (assuming an exchange rate of around 8). The TUP group
sees a 327 SSP ($41 US, 7%) increase in annual average income, but with a highly
skewed distribution and large standard errors. The related figure shows that total
income is not particularly different among groups. Perhaps the main lesson is that
the TUP group has measurably more reported livestock-related income, and less farm
income, indicating a shift away from farming. The cash group may exhibit some
substitution away from farm and livestock, but as is evident graphically, we do not
observe sizable changes in total income for either treatment group.

** Exposure to Conflict

In 2014, households were surveyed shortly after the NGO's offices had re-opened in
the wake of the outbreak of widespread armed conflict. Respondents were asked a short
set of questions about whether they were directly affected, and if so, in what way.
There has only been a few incidents of violence near Yei town at that point, and the most
directly involved ethnic groups made up a small portion of the local population. There
is no clear comparison group to which we might compare our sample, and the economic
climate changed over this same period in several ways that were probably not directly
caused by the violence. As such, we have no clear means of identifying the effect of
the conflict itself on household welfare. Nonetheless, it is interesting to consider
correlates with self-reported exposure to the conflict, and to see if program
assignment had any effect on households' exposure or response.

Our main outcomes of interest are whether individuals say they were "worried" or
"directly affected" by the violence, unable to invest in a farm or business as a
result, migrated as a cautionary measure, or did something else to protect the lives
of family members. A final question among those who took no cautionary measures was
whether this because they did not have the means (i.e. "NoMeans"). TUP participants
are 24% (13 pp.) less likely to report having been "affected" by the conflict, and
38% (6 pp.) less likely to report that they were affected specifically by being
unable to plant crops or invest in their business. This was the second most common
way in which households reported being affected behind "needed to relocate or
migrate", where respondents are not clearly different. Nonetheless, this raises the
possibility that having received a significant asset transfer and the expectation of
NGO support around the outbreak of
conflict may have helped mitigate the conflict's negative effect on investment and
protect households from being affected overall.
